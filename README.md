# 🌐 OmniAble: Unified Accessibility for Bharat

**A centralized, AI-driven architecture empowering the disabled community across India.**

---

## 📌 Submission Note
This repository contains the **System Specification and Architectural Blueprint** for the AI for Bharat Hackathon. It follows a **Design-First** approach, detailing the technical logic and requirements for a unified accessibility hub.

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Track: Communities & Access)
Current assistive technology in Bharat is fragmented. Users with multiple or diverse disabilities must navigate separate, non-localized apps. There is a critical lack of a single, scalable platform that integrates:
1. **Vision Assistance** (Scene description & localized TTS)
2. **Hearing Support** (Indian Sign Language conversion)
3. **Cognitive Simplification** (Complex text-to-simple regional language)
4. **Motor Control** (Gesture and voice-based navigation)
5. **Speech Support** (Predictive communication aids)

## ✨ The Solution: OmniAble
OmniAble provides a unified hub that consolidates these five pillars into one seamless interface. It is designed to be:
* **Localized:** Native support for Indian Sign Language (ISL) and regional dialects.
* **Low-Latency:** Optimized for India’s diverse network conditions through edge-caching and serverless logic.
* **Unified:** A single point of access for all accessibility needs, reducing the cognitive and financial burden on the user.

## 🏗️ System Logic & Architecture
* **Intelligent Processing:** Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-time text simplification and image-to-speech.
* **Neural Audio & Speech:** Real-time multi-lingual synthesis and streaming transcription.
* **Sign Synthesis:** Computational mapping of text to animated sign language sequences.
* **Edge Delivery:** Global content distribution to ensure high performance in rural and urban areas.
